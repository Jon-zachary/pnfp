// Use your JavaScript knowledge to solve this puzzle:

// 1. Count up from one to 100 and console log each number
// 2. Introduce some logic so that if a number is divisible by 3, it prints 'fuzz' instead of the number
// 3. Introduce more logic so that if a number is divisible by 5, it prints 'bang' instead of the number
// 4. Finally, if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'fuzzbang'.

// Good luck!
