# Programming for Non-Programmers

This is the repo for the code, slides, and instructor notes for General Assembly's Programming for Non-Programmers, as taught by Vincent Trivett.

 I initially taught this class in December, 2016. Each time I teach this class, I push up solutions and tweak the lesson plans in response to student feedback and changes in the technology landscape.

If you would like to contribute or comment on the lesson plan itself, please open an issue.
